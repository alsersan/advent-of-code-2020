# Advent Of Code 2020

My solutions to the [Advent Of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) problems.

I didn't refactor any of the code to find more optimized solutions. I kept it as I wrote it the first time, to keep a record of my coding abilities at the moment and to (hopefully) see some improvement.
